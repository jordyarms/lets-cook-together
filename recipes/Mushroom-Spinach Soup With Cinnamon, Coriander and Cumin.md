## Ingredients	

### Vegetables
- [M.::300 g pounds] mixed mushrooms (such as cremini, oyster, chanterelles and shiitake), chopped
- [M.::225 g] shallots, finely diced
- [M.::150 g] baby spinach

### Liquids
- Fresh lime juice, to taste
- [M.::1 tbsp] tomato paste
- Plain yogurt, for serving (optional)

### Oils
- [M.::6 tbsp] unsalted butter or extra-virgin olive oil

### Spices
- [M.::2 tsp] chopped fresh thyme leaves
- [M.::1 1/2 tsp] ground cumin
- [M.::1 tsp] ground coriander
- [M.::3/4 tsp] ground cinnamon
- [M.::2 1/2 tsp] kosher salt, more to taste
- [M.::1 tsp] black pepper
- Pinch ground allspice



## Directions
- Heat 3 tbsp butter or oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add half the mushrooms and half the shallots; cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has evaporated and the mushrooms are well browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer mushrooms to a bowl and repeat with remaining butter, mushrooms and shallots.
- Return all mushrooms to the pot and stir in tomato paste, thyme, cumin, coriander, cinnamon and allspice; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
- Stir in 5 cups water, the salt and the black pepper. Bring mixture to a simmer over medium heat and cook gently for 20 minutes. Stir in baby spinach and let cook until just wilted, 1 to 2 minutes.
- Using an immersion blender or food processor, coarsely pur√©e soup. Mix in lime juice. Thin with water, as needed. Taste and adjust seasoning, if necessary. Serve with dollops of yogurt if you'd like.
