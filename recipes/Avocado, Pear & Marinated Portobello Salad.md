## Ingredients

for the vinaigrette (makes ¾ cup):

- ¼ cup [[apple cider vinegar]]
- 3 tbsp [[olive oil]]
- 2 tbsp [[balsamic vinegar]]
- 2 tbsp unsweetened [[applesauce]] (can omit & replace with 1 tbsp olive oil + splash balsamic vin.)
- 1 tbsp [[maple syrup]]
- 1 ½ tsp [[dijon mustard]]
- 2 cloves [[garlic]]
- ¼ tsp [[salt]] & [[pepper]], to taste

for the salad:

- 2 large [[portobello mushrooms]]
- 1 small [[red onion]], thinly sliced
- 1 package [[mixed greens]]
- 2 ripe [[pears]], peeled, cored and chopped
- 1 [[avocado]], pitted and chopped
- 1/3 cup [[walnuts]], toasted


## Directions

1. Make the Vinaigrette: In a small bowl, whisk together all of the ingredients, or simply combine them in a jar and shake. Will keep in an airtight container in the fridge for at least 2 weeks. Feel free to adjust this dressing to suit your tastes!
2. Clean mushrooms and pat dry; remove stems and either discard or reserve for another use (stir fry etc). You can decide to either slice the mushroom caps now or wait until after cooking (step 4 below); mushrooms will soak in more marinade if sliced at this stage.
3. In a large bowl (or sealed container) combine mushroom caps, onion and half of the vinaigrette and toss until fully coated. Marinate mixture for 20-30 mins, tossing every 5-10 mins.
4. Heat a pan over med-high heat. Place mushroom and onion in pan and grill for 3-6 mins per side, until veggies are tender. Reduce heat if necessary. Slice into strips if not already done.
5. Assemble all salad ingredients & toss to combine!
