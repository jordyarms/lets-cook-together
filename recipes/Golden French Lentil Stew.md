## Ingredients

- ½ cup raw cashews
- 2 cups water
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 large onion, diced
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 ½ tsp salt, to taste
- 2 medium carrots, diced
- 2 stalks celery, diced
- 2 tsp ground cumin
- 1 ½ tsp dried thyme
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 1 can diced tomatoes, with juices
- ¾ cup uncooked green lentils, rinsed and drained
- 4-5 cups veggie broth
- 3 cups swiss chard or kale, stemmed and chopped
- Ground black pepper, to taste
- 1-2 tsp white wine vinegar, to taste

## Directions

1. Place cashews in bowl and cover with a couple inches of water. Soak for 3-4 hours or overnight (for quick-soak method, cover with boiling water for 1-2 hours). Drain and rinse. Transfer cashews to a high-speed blender along with ½ cups water and blend on high until smooth. Set aside.
2. In a large pot, heat oil over medium heat. Stir in onion, garlic, and couple pinches of salt, and sauté until onion is softened, 4-6 minutes.
3. Stir in carrots and celery and cook for ~2-3 minutes. Stir in cumin, thyme, turmeric until combined.
4. Add diced tomatoes with their juices, lentils, broth and remaining water. Increase heat to high and bring to a low boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, uncovered for 30-35 minutes, until the lentils are tender.
5. Stir in the cashew cream and chard/kale. Season with salt, pepper and vinegar to taste (the vinegar’s role is to lend brightness to the dish; add only a little at a time, as it can quickly overwhelm!)
6. Cook for a few mins over low-medium until chard/kale is wilted.
7. *Will keep in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days or freeze for 1-2 months.
