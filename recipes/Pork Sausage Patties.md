## Ingredients

- [ ] Meat
	- [ ] 500g/ 1 lb pork mince ([[ground pork]]) (sub chicken, turkey)
- [ ] Spices
	- [ ] 1 tsp dried ground [[sage]] (secret ingredient! Note 1)
	- [ ] 1/2 tsp dried [[thyme]] , crushed with fingers (Note 2)
	- [ ] 1 tsp [[onion powder]] (sub more garlic powder)

## Instructions

1. **Make patties -** Place sausage pattie ingredients in a bowl and mix well with your hands. Divide into 8 and form 1 cm / 0.4" thick patties. Make a shallow dent in the middle of the surface - this prevents the patties from doming as they cook.
2. **Cook 4 minutes -** Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large non stick pan over medium high heat. Cook half the patties for 2 minutes on each side until golden. Transfer to a paper towel lined plate. Heat remaining oil and cook remaining patties.
