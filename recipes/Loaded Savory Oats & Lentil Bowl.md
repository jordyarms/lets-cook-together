## Directions

1. In a medium saucepan or pot, combine the broth (or water + bouillon cube, if using), oats, lentils, garlic and shallot. Bring the mixture to a low boil over medium-heat heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered for 8-12 mins, or until thickened. Season with salt and pepper.
