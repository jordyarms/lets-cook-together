## Ingredients

- [ ] 1 large [[eggplant]] diced into 2- cubes
- [ ] 8 ounces [[baby bella mushrooms]] halved
- [ ] 1 14- ounce can full-fat [[coconut milk]] divided
- [ ] Â½ [[yellow onion]] chopped
- [ ] 1 tablespoon fresh [[ginger]] peeled and grated
- [ ] 3 cloves [[garlic]] minced
- [ ] 1 dried [[red chili seeds]] removed and crushed
- [ ] 1 teaspoon [[paprika]]
- [ ] 1 tablespoon ground [[cumin]]
- [ ] 2 teaspoons ground [[corriander]]
- [ ] 1 teaspoon ground [[turmeric]]
- [ ] 1 teaspoon [[salt, sea salt]] or to taste
- [ ] 1 [[tomatoes, diced, 14 oz can]] drained


## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
2. Spread the eggplant and mushrooms on two baking sheets. Drizzle generously with olive oil and sea salt. Place in the oven and roast for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven, flip the veggies, and roast an additional 10 to 15 minutes.
3. While the vegetables are roasting, make the curry sauce. To do so, add about 1/3 cup of the coconut milk to a saucepan, along with the onion, ginger, and garlic. Saute, stirring occasionally, until the onion is soft and translucent, and the coconut milk has been absorbed, about 10 minutes. Add the spices and saute an additional 3 minutes. Add the remaining coconut milk and diced tomatoes. Bring to a full boil, then reduce the heat. Allow the sauce to continue cooking at a controlled boil, stirring occasionally, until thick, about 15 minutes.
4. Add the roasted vegetables to the saucepan, stir well to coat, then serve curry with cooked brown rice, quinoa, or cauliflower rice.
