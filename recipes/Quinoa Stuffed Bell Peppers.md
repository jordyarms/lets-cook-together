## Ingredients
- 1 cup quinoa
- 2 cups water

- 1 teaspoon cumin
- 1 teaspoon chili powder

## Directions
1. Preheat your oven to 375 degrees. 
2. Cook the quinoa according to the package instructions, usually simmering it in water for about 15 minutes. 
3. In a large bowl, mix the cooked quinoa, black beans, corn, tomatoes, 1/2 of the cheese, cumin, chili powder, salt, and pepper. Spoon the quinoa mixture into the bell peppers, and place the peppers in a baking dish.
