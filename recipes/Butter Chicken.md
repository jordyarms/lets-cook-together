- [M.::3 pounds] chicken thighs, on the bone
- [M.::1 1/2 cups] cream
- [M.::1 1/2 cups] full-fat Greek yogurt
- [M.::1 1/2 tbsp] ground turmeric
- [M.::1 1/2 tsp] tomato paste
- [M.::1 tbsp] cumin seeds

## Directions
- Whisk together the yogurt, lemon juice, turmeric, garam masala and cumin in a large bowl. Put the chicken in, and coat with the marinade. Cover, and refrigerate (for up to a day).
- In a large pan over medium heat, melt the butter in the oil until it starts to foam. Add the onions, and cook, stirring frequently, until translucent. Add the garlic, ginger and cumin seeds, and cook until the onions start to brown.
- Add the cinnamon stick, tomatoes, chiles and salt, and cook until the chiles are soft, about 10 minutes.
- Add the chicken and marinade to the pan, and cook for 5 minutes, then add the chicken stock. Bring the mixture to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer, uncovered, for approximately 30 minutes.
- Stir in the cream and tomato paste, and simmer until the chicken is cooked through, approximately 10 to 15 minutes.
- Add the almonds, cook for an additional 5 minutes and remove from the heat. Garnish with the cilantro leaves.
