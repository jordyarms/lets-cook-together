## Ingredients

- 255g spaghetti pasta noodles
- 3-4 cloves garlic
- ¼ cup fresh basil leaves, plus more for serving if desired
- 4-6 tsp fresh lemon juice, to taste
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 ripe medium avocado, pitted
- ¼ - ½ tsp salt, to taste
- Ground black pepper
- Lemon zest, for serving (optional)

## Directions

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta according to its package instructions.
2. While pasta cooks, make the sauce: In a food processor or blender, combine garlic and basil, and pulse to mince.
3. Add lemon juice, avocado flesh and 1 tbsp water and process until smooth (stopping to scrape down the sides as needed). If sauce is too thick, add another 1 tbsp of water. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Drain pasta and place back in pot. Add avocado sauce and stir until combined.
5. Top with lemon zest, pepper and fresh basil, if desired.
6. Tip: because avocados oxidize quickly after you slice them, the sauce is best served immediately; to store leftover, transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 1 day.
