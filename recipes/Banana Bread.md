## Ingredients 

- [ ] 1 1/2 cups (380g) ripe and mashed [[banana]] (3-4 medium bananas), measured
- [ ] 1/2 cup (100g) packed light [[brown sugar]]
- [ ] 1/2 cup (100g) granulated [[sugar]]
- [ ] 1/2 cup (110g) [[unsalted butter]], melted
- [ ] 2 large [[eggs]]
- [ ] 1 tsp [[vanilla extract]]
- [ ] 1/2 cup (130g) 2% [[yogurt, greek]] (sour cream also works)
- [ ] 1 1/3 cups (180g) all-purpose [[flour]]
- [ ] 1 tsp [[baking soda]]
- [ ] 1/2 tsp [[salt]]
- [ ] 3/4 cup (140g) mini [[chocolate chips]] + a handful more for sprinkling on top

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 325F and grease and line a 9Ã—5 loaf pan with parchment paper.
2. In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
3. In a separate bowl, mix together the melted butter and sugars until you reach a paste-like consistency. This may take some vigorous whisking for a minute or two. You can either use a whisk or an electric mixer with the paddle attachment.
4. Add in your mashed bananas followed by the eggs, yogurt, and vanilla.
5. Once all of your wet ingredients are mixed together, fold in the dry ingredients. Then, fold in the chocolate chips.
6. Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan and spread it even. Sprinkle extra chocolate chips on top if you like.
7. Bake for 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes or until a toothpick comes out with a few moist crumbs. Let it cool completely before removing from the pan. Store at room temperature in an air-tight container.
