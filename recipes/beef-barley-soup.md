## Instructions

### Prep Phase (15 minutes)
1. **Cube chuck roast** into 1-inch pieces, removing excess fat
2. **Prepare vegetables**: Dice onion, slice carrots and celery, mince garlic
3. **Measure ingredients**: Have tomato paste, soy sauce, and spices ready

### Searing Phase (8 minutes)
4. **Heat Dutch oven** over medium-high heat
5. **Sear beef cubes** for 4-5 minutes until browned on all sides
6. **Transfer beef** to bowl and set aside

### Vegetable Base (5 minutes)
7. **Add olive oil** to same pot
8. **Sauté vegetables**: Add carrots, celery, onion, and garlic
9. **Cook 2-3 minutes** until softened

### Flavor Building (2 minutes)
10. **Add aromatics**: Stir in soy sauce, tomato paste, thyme, rosemary, and salt
11. **Sauté 1 minute** until fragrant

### Simmering Phase (50 minutes)
12. **Return beef** to pot
13. **Add liquid and grain**: Pour in beef broth, add bay leaf and barley
14. **Bring to boil**, then cover and reduce to simmer
15. **Simmer 40-50 minutes** until barley is tender and beef is fork-tender
16. **Remove bay leaf** before serving

## Serving & Storage

**Serve**: Ladle into bowls, garnish with fresh herbs if desired
**Leftovers**: Store covered in refrigerator 3-4 days
**Reheating**: Add extra broth if needed, soup thickens when refrigerated
**Freezing**: Freezes well for 3 months, barley may soften slightly

## Recipe Notes

### Scaling Guidelines
- **Double recipe**: Use larger pot, may need extra cooking time
- **Half recipe**: Reduce cooking time by 10 minutes
- **Serving size**: 1.5 cups per serving for hearty meal

### Customization Options
**Vegetables**: Add mushrooms, parsnips, or potatoes
**Grain substitutes**: Brown rice, farro, or wheat berries
**Protein alternatives**: Beef stew meat, short ribs, or brisket
**Herb variations**: Add fresh parsley or dill at the end

### Troubleshooting
**Beef too tough**: Cook longer until fork-tender
**Soup too thick**: Add more broth or water
**Soup too thin**: Simmer uncovered to reduce
**Barley overcooked**: Add during last 30 minutes next time
