## Ingredients
- 1/2 pound fresh asparagus, medium thickness
- Salt
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1/2 tablespoon minced shallots
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 4 ounces smoked salmon sliced 1/4-inch thick
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
- 9 to 10 ounces fresh green fettuccine noodles
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh dill

## Directions
- Step 1
	- Snap off the ends of the asparagus where they break naturally and peel the stalks.
	- Cut the asparagus on a slant to pieces about an inch long.
- Step 2
	- Steam the asparagus until they are just barely tender and still bright green, about three minutes. 
	- Rinse under cold water, drain well on paper towels and set aside.
- Step 3 – Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for the pasta.
- Step 4
	- While the water is coming to a boil, melt the butter in a large heavy skillet.
	- Add the shallots and sauté until soft but not brown. 
	- Stir in the cream and simmer about five minutes, until the cream has thickened somewhat.
- Step 5
	- Cut the salmon into slivers, add it to the cream and remove the skillet from the heat.
	- Season with pepper and lemon juice.
	- Add the asparagus.
- Step 6 – When the pot of water is boiling, add the fettuccine, stir it once or twice, then cook two to three minutes after the water has returned to a boil. Drain well.
- Step 7 –  Briefly reheat the sauce. Transfer the fettuccine to a warm serving bowl, pour the sauce over it and toss. Sprinkle with dill and serve.
