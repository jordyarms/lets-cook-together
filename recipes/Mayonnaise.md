## Ingredients
- [M.::1] Egg
- [M.::1 tbsp]Mustard
- [M.::1 tbsp] Vinegar
- [M.::1 tsp] Lemon juice
- [M.::1 cup] Neutral Flavoured Oil
- [M.::1/4 tsp] salt

## Directions
1. **Prepare your food processor**. I prefer to use the small bowl attachment that came with our food processor to make mayonnaise.
2. **Add an egg** to the bowl of your food processor and process for about 20 seconds.
3. **Add mustard, vinegar, and salt** then process for another 20 seconds.
4. **Slowly add the oil**, in tiny drops, until about a quarter of the oil has been added. Adding the oil slowly is really important. If you were to dump it all in at once, youâ€™d have mayonnaise soup!
5. **Taste the mayonnaise** and adjust with additional salt and vinegar or lemon juice.
