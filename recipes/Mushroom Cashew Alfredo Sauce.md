## Directions

- Cook Pasta: 
	- Set salted water to boil in a large pot and cook pasta according to directions.
	- If using fresh or frozen peas, feel free to add to the pasta water, during the last minute of cooking.
- Make Alfredo Sauce: 
	- Heat oil over med low heat, and sauté onion and garlic until tender and golden. 
	- Place it in a blender along with cashews, veggie broth, nutritional yeast, miso, salt, nutmeg.
	- Blend until creamy and smooth.
- Sauté or smoke the mushrooms.
	- If sautéing, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and sauté 6-7 minutes,  until golden and tender, seasoning with salt.
- Combine: 
	- Drain the pasta, add to a large pan along with the Alfredo sauce, toss, and gently warm over low heat. 
	- Add the mushrooms and toss to coat (leaving a few for the top for garnish if you like).
- Divide among two bowls.
- Garnish with lemon zest, pepper, chili flakes and chopped parsley.

## Notes

- Cashews need to be soaked 4-8 hours in water (and drained) or use a high-powered blender. Or alternatively, simmer the cashews in water boiling water for 10-15 minutes until tender- but soaking really is best. For nut allergies, hemp seeds are a good substitution (and no need to soak).
