- [ ] 3 tablespoons [[vegetable oil]]
- [ ] 2 cans (14 oz each) [[coconut milk]], full fat
- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon [[ginger]]
- [ ] 2 tablespoons chopped [[cilantro]]
- [ ] 2 tablespoons [[brown sugar]]
- [ ] 2 tablespoons [[fish sauce]]
- [ ] 1 tablespoon [[lime juice]]
- [ ] 1 tablespoon [[Worcestershire sauce]]
- [ ] 1 [[onion]]
- [ ] 1 pound [[chicken]]
- [ ] 4 medium [[potatoes]]
- [ ] 2 [[carrots]]

- [ ] 1/2 cup [[peanuts]]
- [ ] [[sriracha]] sauce to taste
- [ ] [[red pepper flakes]] to taste
- [ ] [[rice, jasmine]] (cooked)

## Instructions

1. Heat vegetable oil in an extra large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Stir in curry paste; cook and stir for about 2-3 minutes. This is strong, make sure your windows are open and a fan is blowing.
2. Add 1 can coconut milk and stir until well blended. Add ginger, cilantro, sugar, fish sauce, lime juice, and Worcestershire. Bring to a boil.
3. Thinly slice the onion and chicken, then add them to the sauce. Reduce to a simmer. When chicken is white and cooked through (about 5 min or so) add another can of coconut milk and bring back to a boil.
4. Peel and dice potatoes. Peel and slice carrots. Add the potatoes, carrots, and remaining ingredients (except for the rice) and stir until everything is well mixed. Cover and simmer for about 15 minutes or until potatoes are no longer crunchy in the middle. Serve hot over Jasmine rice and garnish with extra cilantro and/or limes if desired.
