## Ingredients
- 1 tbsp coconut oil or olive oil
- 1 sweet onion, diced
- 4-5 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 cups mushrooms, sliced (cremini or white button)
- 1 cup chopped carrots (approx. 2-3 carrots)
- 2 cups broccoli florets
- Salt & pepper, to taste
- 2-3 tsp fresh ginger, grated and peeled
- ½ tsp ground turmeric
- 2 tsp ground cumin
- 1/8 tsp ground cinnamon (seems weird, but trust!)
- 5 cups veggie broth
- 2 large nori seaweed sheets, cut into 1-inch strips
- 2 cups kale leaves (de-stemmed and roughly chopped/torn)
- Fresh lemon juice, for serving (optional)
## Directions

1. Heat a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add olive oil, onion and garlic. Sauté for ~5 minsj until onion is translucent.
2. Add mushrooms, carrots and broccoli and stir to combine. Season generously with salt & pepper and sauté for 5 minutes more.
3. Stir in ginger, turmeric, cumin and cinnamon and sauté for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant.
4. Add the broth and stir to combine. Bring mixture to a boil and then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 15-20 minutes.
5. Just before serving, add the nori (if using) and kale and cook until wilted. Season with salt & pepper and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, if desired.
6. Note: if you want to create a larger batch, simply increase portions of broth, veggies, garlic, salt and a sprinkle more turmeric and cumin!
