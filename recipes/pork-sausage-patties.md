    text: "Heat large non-stick pan over medium-high heat. No oil needed - pork has enough fat to prevent sticking. Cook first batch: 4 patties, 2 minutes per side until golden brown. Internal temperature should reach 160Â°F for food safety. Drain on paper towel-lined plate. Cook remaining 4 patties the same way."
